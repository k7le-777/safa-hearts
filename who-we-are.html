                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Safa Hearts began with a simple belief: compassion
                            is one of the most powerful forces for positive change.
                            Founded by someone who once needed help himself, Safa Hearts grew out of the support
                            and generosity he experienced. Inspired by the Islamic principle of sadaqah — voluntary
                            acts of charity and kindness — we work to make giving and caring a way of life for 
                            everyone. While our values are rooted in a rich tradition of service, our doors are 
                            open to all. We welcome every heart that wishes to help another, regardless of faith or
                            background. Together we can lift lives, ease hardship, and spread hope.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every day, we witness the ripple of kindness spreading through communities. One act of 
                            help sparks another, creating a chain of goodwill that touches countless lives. At Safa 
                            Hearts, we believe every small gesture matters, and every heart has the power to make a 
                            difference.

                            <p>Right now, it’s just me — but change doesn’t need a crowd. Inspiration often starts with 
                                one heart willing to act.
                                My journey began at home, noticing the power of small acts of kindness. I extended care to my household, my close 
                                relatives, and then to those in need — travelers, neighbors, and distant communities. It all began with a simple 
                                smile, my first step toward purpose. I didn’t have money at the time (and I still don’t), so I gave what I could: 
                                my time, my effort, my attention. I helped without expectation or recognition, finding contentment in giving for 
                                the sake of Allah. By no means is there perfection — I strive to grow, to learn, and to act with sincerity at 
                                every opportunity. Safa Hearts exists to show that even the smallest act, done with intention, can ripple out to 
                                touch countless lives.
