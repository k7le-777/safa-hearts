# Safa Hearts - Community Support Platform (Vanilla CSS Version)

A responsive, multi-page website connecting people who need help with those who want to give it, built with semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox, and CSS variables.

---
## Project Context

This project was built as part of the Step9Up BootCamp curriculum:
- **Week 2:** Built from scratch using semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox, and CSS variables
- **Week 3:** Migrated to Bootstrap 4.5.2 (see separate repository safa-hearts-bootstrap)

## Project Overview

Safa Hearts is a community support platform designed to bridge the gap between individuals seeking assistance and compassionate volunteers. The website demonstrates modern web development practices including responsive design, flexbox layouts, and accessible form design.

**Live Site:** https://k7le-777.github.io/safa-hearts/  
**Repository:** https://github.com/k7le-777/safa-hearts

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup with proper document structure
- **CSS3** - Custom properties, Flexbox, media queries, pseudo-elements/classes
- **No frameworks** - Vanilla HTML/CSS to demonstrate fundamental skills



## Learning Journey

### Challenges Overcome

**Flexbox Alignment Issues**  
Initially struggled with centering hero content when the HTML structure had nested divs. Learned that flexbox requires proper parent-child relationships and that absolute positioning can break flex alignment. Resolved by restructuring HTML so `.hero-content` was a direct flex child.

**Dropdown Menu Mechanics**  
Took time to understand how `position: relative` on the parent and `position: absolute` on the dropdown created the positioning context. Debugged issues with `opacity`, `visibility`, and `transform` needing to work together for smooth animations. Added `:focus-within` for keyboard accessibility after researching WCAG guidelines.

**Pseudo-element Avatar System**  
Originally tried using `content: url()` for icons in `::after` pseudo-elements, which didn't work. Learned that `background-image` must be used instead, and that pseudo-elements need `display: inline-block` to accept transform properties. This taught me the differences between inline and block-level elements.

**Button Alignment in Cards**  
Cards with varying text lengths caused buttons to appear at different heights. Discovered that adding `display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`, and `margin-top: auto` to the button creates consistent alignment. This was my "aha moment" understanding how flex-grow and auto margins work.

**CSS Variable Mismatches**  
Had several instances where I referenced undefined variables (like `--background-primary`) causing silent failures. Learned to systematically check variable names and understand that CSS fails silently - requiring browser DevTools inspection to debug.

### Key Learnings

**Responsive Design Philosophy**  
Understanding that mobile-first design means starting with constraints and progressively enhancing for larger screens. Media queries aren't just about hiding/showing elements - they're about rethinking layouts entirely.

**CSS Specificity & Cascade**  
Encountered multiple cases where styles weren't applying due to specificity issues. Learned to use browser DevTools to trace which rules were being applied and why. Now understand the hierarchy: inline > ID > class > element.

**Semantic HTML Importance**  
Initially used generic `<div>` containers everywhere. Learned that `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>` improve both accessibility and code organization. Screen readers rely on this structure.

**Form Accessibility**  
Discovered that `<label for="id">` associations, required attributes, and proper input types aren't optional - they're essential for usability. Tested navigation using only keyboard (Tab key) to understand accessibility challenges.

## Technical Decisions

### Why Flexbox Over Grid?
Chose Flexbox because the rubric specified it and it's ideal for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns). Grid would be better for complex two-dimensional layouts, but Flexbox solved all layout needs here.

### Single CSS File vs. Modular
Kept all CSS in one file because the project size didn't warrant complexity of imports. Used clear section comments for organization. Would split into modules (`components.css`, `layout.css`, `pages.css`) for larger projects.

### CSS Variables Strategy
Defined color, spacing, and typography variables in `:root` for consistency. This made theme adjustments easy and reduced repetition. Named variables semantically (`--green-primary`, `--spacing-lg`) rather than by value (`--color-1`, `--size-2`).

### Image Handling
Used relative paths (`img/filename.jpg`) rather than absolute paths for portability. Would implement lazy loading and responsive images (`<picture>` element) for production deployment.

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Desktop:** 1200px+ (default)
- **Tablet:** 768px-1199px (navigation adjusts, cards reflow)
- **Mobile:** 480px-767px (single column, stacked navigation)
- **Small Mobile:** <480px (reduced font sizes, compact spacing)

---

## Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML5 elements throughout
- Keyboard navigation support (`:focus-within` on dropdowns)
- Proper form labels with `for` attributes
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliant)
- Alt text on all images
- Skip-to-content would be added for production

---

## Future Improvements

If I were to continue developing this project, I would add:

1. **JavaScript interactivity** - Form validation, smooth scrolling, mobile hamburger menu
2. **Backend integration** - Connect contact form to email service or database
3. **Performance optimization** - Image lazy loading, CSS minification, critical CSS inline
4. **Testing** - Cross-browser testing, accessibility audit with screen readers
5. **Analytics** - Track user behavior to improve UX
6. **CMS integration** - Allow non-technical updates to content
